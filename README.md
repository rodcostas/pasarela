# Pasarela Digital – Kathia Galindo

Functional digital showroom prototype designed for a Salvadoran fashion brand.

## Overview

Pasarela Digital is an advanced functional prototype created to validate a lightweight, narrative-driven digital infrastructure aligned with the creative process of designer Kathia Galindo.

The project explores an alternative to traditional e-commerce platforms, prioritizing editorial presentation, direct client interaction, and autonomous mobile content management.

## Context

The brand required a flexible digital system that:

- Allowed product updates directly from a mobile device  
- Reflected the aesthetic identity of the designer  
- Enabled direct communication between client and creator  
- Reduced dependency on external platforms  

## Concept: Backstage & Runway

The architecture is inspired by the real dynamics of a fashion runway.

### Backstage (Private Management Interface)

A lightweight content management prototype designed for the designer.

Features:
- Create, edit, and delete pieces  
- Manage materials, sizes, pricing, and availability  
- Upload product photography from mobile  
- Automatic categorization  
- Export catalog in JSON format  

### Runway (Public Interface)

An editorial-style digital showroom focused on visual impact.

Features:
- Large-scale photography  
- Automatic categorization  
- Detailed modal view with materials and pricing  
- Direct conversion via WhatsApp  
- No traditional shopping cart  

The purchase model converts transaction into conversation, reinforcing the brand’s consultative and personalized nature.

## Technical Architecture

The system was built using a lightweight, modular approach:

- Modular HTML structure  
- Custom CSS  
- Vanilla JavaScript  
- JSON-based lightweight data structure  
- GitHub Pages deployment  
- No external dependencies  

Advantages demonstrated in this phase:
- Zero initial maintenance cost  
- High loading speed  
- Full content control  
- Scalable foundation for future professional hosting  

## Development Approach

The prototype was developed using an iterative methodology:

- Initial dialogue with the designer  
- Workflow analysis  
- Conceptual architecture design  
- Progressive implementation  
- Mobile testing and refinement  
- Direct validation with the end user  

Approximate development time: 8 hours of focused work.

## Status

This is a functional prototype designed to validate architecture, user experience, and operational flow.

### Next Steps for Commercial Deployment

- Dedicated hosting and domain  
- Authentication system for Backstage  
- Optional payment integration  
- SEO optimization
